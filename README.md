# php-template
A simple PHP support library I made for my homework... I don't like it, you shouldn't either. It may be useful to avoid boring repetitive boilerplate when donig your homework. Examples in `index.php`, code in `libsalerno.php`.

Yeah, always using C naming conentions for libraries >>>
